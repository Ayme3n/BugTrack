- [ ] Forms have proper validation
- [ ] Error messages display clearly
- [ ] Loading states work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile (test by resizing browser)

---

## 🔒 Security Verification

## 🐛 Common Issues Resolved

If you encountered any of these, verify they're fixed:

- [ ] ~~"Environment variable not found: DIRECT_URL"~~ → Fixed by creating `.env`
- [ ] ~~"Invalid API key"~~ → Fixed by copying correct keys from Supabase
- [ ] ~~"Connection refused"~~ → Fixed by using correct DATABASE_URL
- [ ] ~~"Unauthorized" on dashboard~~ → Fixed by proper session handling
- [ ] ~~User not created in database~~ → Fixed by enabling RLS policies

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Sprint 2: Target Management

Now that authentication is working, you can build:

1. **Target Creation** - Form to add new targets/programs
2. **Target List** - View all your targets
3. **Scope Management** - Define in/out of scope
4. **Target Details** - View individual target info
5. **Target Editing** - Update target information

### Recommended Order:

1. Create target form component
2. Build API route for creating targets
3. Create targets list page
4. Add filtering and search
5. Implement edit/delete functionality

### Reference Documentation:

- See `docs/features/02-targets.md` for complete specification
- Database schema already has `targets` table ready
- Use existing auth patterns from Sprint 1
